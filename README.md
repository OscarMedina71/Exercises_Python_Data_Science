# Exercises_Python_Data_Science
Beginner-level Python exercises focused on data science foundations: lists, dictionaries, sets, normalization, and basic NLP with sets and Counter.

This notebook contains 5 beginner-level Python exercises focused on structures used in data science and machine learning:

-  Vote counting using dictionaries
-  Record transformation using lists
-  Value normalization (min-max)
-  Word frequency analysis using `collections.Counter`
-  Topic recommendation using sets and dictionary iteration

These exercises are part of my roadmap to become a Machine Learning Engineer. Feel free to check the code and logic inside the notebook!
